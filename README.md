# Gesture-Controlled-User-Interface
OpenCV captures the hand gestures of the physician and decodes the movement to interact with the application designed. Gesture recognition technology uses mathematical algorithms and GUI to recognize gestures such as hand movements, etc. This technology has been implemented as it has been found to be a better option to interact with the application without any hardware like mouse or keyboard. The proposed system uses colour markers for gesture recognition using various techniques. The system uses computer vision to seek information or for labelling the required data produced. In the proposed system, the CV has been integrated with image processing to work together to recognize hand gestures and get information for the tumor diagnosis during endoscopy. Specific movements and arrangements of the colour markers will be interpreted into gestures that will act as interaction instructions for the projected applications
